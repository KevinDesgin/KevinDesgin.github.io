    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>
      1. I usally tend to look into the visual element of this intertative
      experience. This would be the visual color of the entire webpage, the use
      of different fonts and the layout of the different element ultizlies with
      the webpage.
    </p>

    <p>2. The list of actions I did in ENDLESS SUMMER:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1. Resizing the entire browser</li>
      <li>
        2. Clicking on a button with the label "NEXT" to head to next
        element/page
      </li>
      <li>3. Holding the image and moving it to different part of the iamge</li>
      <li>4. Clicked on interactable element in image to get animation</li>
      <li>5. Dragged a horizontal wheel scroll that goes to next image</li>
      <li>
        6. Clicked on a button with "three semi coloum" to view an animation
      </li>
      <li>7. Holding the image to change music to a soundscape</li>
    </ul>

      interactable element, holding to change music form music to soundscape and
      watching each uqniue story aniamtion.
    </p>

    <p>

      moving the image to find the interactable element.

    <p>
      5. The primary object this webpage was to immerse the users into an
      interactive narrative based story of taking them on a journeys throughtout
      the beach. This is achieve through the simple and friendly guidence to
      interact with the story and creating a serene and smooth animation to keep
      the users engage with the story.

    <p>
      6. The the guideince through the different simple interactable element
      such as buttons, scroll wheels, clicking and holding helps create a
      smoother narration to the story. The visual layout and the use of of thin
      fonts and lines on the webpage help brings focus towards the main
      objective of this webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
      7. This webpage uses multiple different interaction to help guide and
      engage users to playout the story. This can be seen by finding hidden
      interaction, viewing additional short animation and changing the sound to
