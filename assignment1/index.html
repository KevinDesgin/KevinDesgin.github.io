    <div id="grid-container">
      <div id="box1">
        I usally tend to look into the visual element of this intertative
        experience. This would be the visual color of the entire webpage, the
        use of different fonts and the layout of the different element ultizlies
        with the webpage.
      </div>

      <div id="box2">
        <p>The list of actions I did in ENDLESS SUMMER:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Resizing the entire browser</li>
          <li>
            2. Clicking on a button with the label "NEXT" to head to next
            element/page
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Holding the image and moving it to different part of the iamge
          </li>
          <li>4. Clicked on interactable element in image to get animation</li>
          <li>5. Dragged a horizontal wheel scroll that goes to next image</li>
          <li>
            6. Clicked on a button with "three semi coloum" to view an animation
          </li>
          <li>7. Holding the image to change music to a soundscape</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="box3">
        I spent the majority of time going through each images to find an
        interactable element, holding to change music form music to soundscape
        and watching each uqniue story aniamtion.
      </div>

      <div id="box4">
        The most commom action that I did within this interactable webpage was
        moving the image to find the interactable element.
      </div>

      <div id="box5">
        The primary object this webpage was to immerse the users into an
        interactive narrative based story of taking them on a journeys
        throughtout the beach. This is achieve through the simple and friendly
        guidence to interact with the story and creating a serene and smooth
        animation to keep the users engage with the story.
      </div>

      <div id="box6">
        The the guideince through the different simple interactable element such
        as buttons, scroll wheels, clicking and holding helps create a smoother
        narration to the story. The visual layout and the use of of thin fonts
        and lines on the webpage help brings focus towards the main objective of
        this webpage.
      </div>

      <div id="box7">
        This website uses multiple different interaction to help guide and
        engage users to playout the story. This can be seen by finding hidden
        interaction, viewing additional short animation and changing the sound
        to enhance users engagment longer.
      </div>

      <div id="box8">
        Users are able to track their progression through the visual layout of
        the progression bar within the scroll wheel and within each chapter
        illustration. However this webpage does not allow users to backtrack
        story and does not save progression which suggest that it is a story
        that should be played in one sitting.
      </div>

      <div id="box9">
        This website has a direct connection to an online website "Richard
        Mille" that sells watches. Hence this can be found within the domain
        name and the introductory page. Within this online shop sells a specific
        watch called "RM 07-01 coloured ceramics" that reveals a specific colour
        scheme that are similar to the visual color of the interactive webpage.
      </div>

      <div id="box10">
        The way that this interactive based website is desgined to be an
        interactive narrative suggest that users are encourge to slowly spend
        time to immerse themself to the story as if they should invest time into
        what they are doing in life.
      </div>

      <div id="box11">
        The way that the story is narrated to be a serene journey of going to
        the beach suggest that the website is aimed to guide users through a
        relax trip of adventuring through a peaceful day at the beach and
        engross users to the serence visual and animation.
      </div>

      <div id="box12">
        The most fustrating part of this website was the endless dragging and
        clicking to find small hidden interactionand some part seemed to not
        have one at all.
      </div>
      <div id="box13">
        The most satisfying part of this website was the visual color and
        animation that engorssed me to admire the story even more.
