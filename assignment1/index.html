    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>
      1. I usally tend to look into the visual element of this intertative
      experience. This would be the visual color of the entire webpage, the use
      of different fonts and the layout of the different element ultizlies with
      the webpage.
    </p>

    <p>2. The list of actions I did in ENDLESS SUMMER:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1. Resizing the entire browser</li>
      <li>
        2. Clicking on a button with the label "NEXT" to head to next
        element/page
      </li>
      <li>3. Holding the image and moving it to different part of the iamge</li>
      <li>4. Clicked on interactable element in image to get animation</li>
      <li>5. Dragged a horizontal wheel scroll that goes to next image</li>
      <li>
        6. Clicked on a button with "three semi coloum" to view an animation
      </li>
      <li>7. Holding the image to change music to a soundscape</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      3. I spent the majority of time going through each images to find an
      interactable element, holding to change music form music to soundscape and
      watching each uqniue story aniamtion.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. The most commom action that I did within this interactable webpage was
      moving the image to find the interactable element.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. The primary object this webpage was to immerse the users into an
      interactive narrative based story of taking them on a journeys throughtout
      the beach. This is achieve through the simple and friendly guidence to
      interact with the story and creating a serene and smooth animation to keep
      the users engage with the story.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. The the guideince through the different simple interactable element
      such as buttons, scroll wheels, clicking and holding helps create a
      smoother narration to the story. The visual layout and the use of of thin
      fonts and lines on the webpage help brings focus towards the main
      objective of this webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
      7. This website uses multiple different interaction to help guide and
      engage users to playout the story. This can be seen by finding hidden
      interaction, viewing additional short animation and changing the sound to
      enhance users engagment longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      8. Users are able to track their progression through the visual layout of
      the progression bar within the scroll wheel and within each chapter
      illustration. However this webpage does not allow users to backtrack story
      and does not save progression which suggest that it is a story that should
      be played in one sitting.
    </p>

    <p>
      9. This website has a direct connection to an online website "Richard
      Mille" that sells watches. Hence this can be found within the domain name
      and the introductory page. Within this online shop sells a specific watch
      called "RM 07-01 coloured ceramics" that reveals a specific colour scheme
      that are similar to the visual color of the interactive webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
      10. The way that this interactive based website is desgined to be an
      interactive narrative suggest that users are encourge to slowly spend time
      to immerse themself to the story as if they should invest time into what
      they are doing in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      11. The way that the story is narrated to be a serene journey of going to
      the beach suggest that the website is aimed to guide users through a relax
      trip of adventuring through a peaceful day at the beach and engross users
      to the serence visual and animation.
    </p>

    <p>
      12. The most fustrating part of this website was the endless dragging and
      clicking to find small hidden interactionand some part seemed to not have
      one at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      13. The most satisfying part of this website was the visual color and
      animation that engorssed me to admire the story even more.
